							It gives us immense pleasure to invite you to be a part of our Aravind Glaucoma Education Services Silver Jubilee Celebrations! Established in 1976 with a vision to eliminate needless blindness, Aravind Eye Care System has completed 40 years of commendable service. Having always believed in training and equipping doctors with not only knowledge but also ethics and quality work, glaucoma fellowships commenced in 1992. Since then Aravind Glaucoma Education Services have trained around 70 international and 600 national Ophthalmologists through long-term, short-term and customized fellowships. Today, we have our fellows in 64 countries, practicing glaucoma care and spreading the knowledge that they have acquired at Aravind.
							The CME is being organized to celebrate the Silver Jubilee of initiation of glaucoma training at Aravind. The highlight of the forum being lectures and live surgery sessions by renowned national and international faculty. It definitely promises to be academically as well as professionally rejuvenating with an opportunity to meet, listen to and share the experiences with the experts in the field.
							Welcome you all to the spiritual and beautiful city, Pondicherry this October.
